<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many Sites for GGSIPU resources but no one provides resources for new branches like csam and cyber and others alike. this site solves for that and focuses on to point exam resources like pyqs and videos.
We strictly discourage using pirated book links, So our site does not provide that other authentic materials like pyqs video links and playlist are available in an easy to access way.
